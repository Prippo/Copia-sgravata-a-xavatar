# discord-js-nukebot

This is a code example for a discord.js nukebot. It deletes all channels, creates new, changes all nicknames and send a message to the server owner. 

How to use it? 

> install Visual Studio Code and Node.js

> download the repository

> visit `https://discord.com/developers`, create an app, a bot and copy the token

> in your terminal, type `npm init` and follow the instructions. Next type `npm install discord.js fs`

> in the VSC project, edit config.json and add commands in the folder

> for start the bot, type in the terminal `node index.js`

Let's test it!
